IIT Gandhinagar, India. Learning **Computer Vision and Graphics**.

Hey there! I am an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am currently interested in learning more about and working in computer vision and graphics. It was when I got an opportunity to work on a research paper on inverse rendering of translucent objects that I got exposed to these exciting fields. I have taken introductory courses in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at my institute and am rapidly enhancing my knowledge in these fields this summer.
I have had a desire to do cutting-edge research from my school days, and I have finally figured out my field of choice. Hence, I intend to study further (get a master's or PhD) and contribute to Computer Vision, enabling machines to perceive the world just like humans (or even better!).

I am currently studying about 3D Gaussian Splatting and how it can be used for inverse rendering.
