This is just a jupyter notebook of the assignment that I worked on a while back. A much nicer post coming within a week.

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/CornerDetection.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/CornerDetection.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
{% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}

<p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
