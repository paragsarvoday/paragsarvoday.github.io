## What exactly is this technique?
3D Gaussian Splatting is one of the solutions to the **Novel View Synthesis** problem.

Novel View Synthesis? That seems quite complicated, I don't think this is my cup of tea.

Well, don't stop reading just yet. Its not as contrived as it seems at first glance.
Let's start by understanding the literal meaning of the term 'Novel View Synthesis'. It is made up of *novel* which means *new*, view is quite self-explanatory and *synthesis* means *to combine different elements to make something new*. So, the process goes something like this, we have a bunch of pictures of a room (say) and now we want to view the room from angles which were not present in the original set of pictures. To fulfill this desire of ours, we need to *synthesize* (make) these *novel* (new) views.


<!--Make a nice GIF or a small video to illustrate the Novel View Synthesis-->

Now, there had been many attempts to solve the Novel View Synthesis problem but none of the attempts made for a convincing solution until 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) appeared in 2023.
Let's understand how it works! 

## Foundation

Before moving to the actual workings of 3DGS, let's lay a firm foundational knowledge about gaussians.

### 1D Gaussian function

Starting off with 1D gaussian function, its general form is given as:

$$
g(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} \frac{(x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2} \right)
$$

Here, $\sigma$ is the spread of the gaussian and $\mu$ is the centre value of it. We query the function by substituting a value in place of the variable $x$.

Check out the visualisation below for a better understanding:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-12 mx-auto mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3dgs_blog/1dgs.png" 
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

<!--Add a drop down toggle -->

{% details An interesting detail about 1D gaussians%}
Gaussian functions arise by composing the exponential function with a concave quadratic function (downward facing parabola)

$$f(x) = \exp(\alpha x^2 + \beta x + \gamma)$$

where $$\alpha = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}, \quad \beta = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}, \quad \gamma = -\frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2} - \ln(\sigma \sqrt{2\pi})$$
{% enddetails %}

### 2D Gaussian function

The 2D Gaussian function in our familiar form would look something like:

$$
g(x, y) = A \exp \left( - \left( \frac{(x - \mu_x)^2}{2\sigma_X^2} + \frac{(y - \mu_y)^2}{2\sigma_Y^2} \right) \right)
$$

Here, $A$ is the amplitude, $\mu_x$, $\mu_y$ are the centers, and $\sigma_X$, $\sigma_Y$ are the spreads of the 2D gaussian in the $X$ and $Y$ axes respectively.

Again, a visualisation to help form a mental picture:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-12 mx-auto mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3dgs_blog/2dgs.png" 
        class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A 2D gaussian function
</div>

### 3D Gaussian function

As a natural extension to the 2D Gaussian's definition, we get to the 3D Gaussian function which is given as:

$$
g(x, y, z) = A \cdot \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{(x - \mu_x)^2}{\sigma_x^2} + \frac{(y - \mu_y)^2}{\sigma_y^2} + \frac{(z - \mu_z)^2}{\sigma_z^2} \right) \right)
$$

An alternate definition of a 3D Gaussian that is often seen in various place (eg. the 3DGS paper!) goes like:

$$
f(x, y, z) = A \cdot \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{r} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\top \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{r} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) \right)
$$

where:  

$A = (2\pi)^{-3/2} \det(\Sigma)^{-1/2}$ is the normalization constant

$\mathbf{r} = [x, y, z]^\top$ is the position vector

$\boldsymbol{\mu} = [\mu_x, \mu_y, \mu_z]^\top$ is the center of the Gaussian

$\Sigma^{-1}$ is the inverse of the covariance matrix


{% details Equation for N-dimensional Gaussian function%}
Gaussian functions arise by composing the exponential function with a concave quadratic function (downward facing parabola)

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{N/2} |\boldsymbol{\Sigma}|^{1/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})^\mathsf{T} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x} - \boldsymbol{\mu})\right)
$$
{% enddetails %}

For 3D Gaussian, the $\Sigma$ matrix would look something like this:

$$
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{xz} \\ 
\sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{yz} \\ 
\sigma_{xz} & \sigma_{yz} & \sigma_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where:   
* the diagonal elements $(\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$, $\sigma_{zz})$ represent the variances along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes. 
* the off-diagonal elements $(\sigma_{xy}, \sigma_{xz}, \sigma_{yz})$ represent covariances between pairs of axes $(x, y, z)$.
